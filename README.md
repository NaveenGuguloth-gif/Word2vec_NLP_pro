<h1>Word2Vec </h1>
<br> </br>
<p>Trained a Word2Vec model on the Game of Thrones dataset to learn semantic relationships between characters, places, and events.
  Reduced the high-dimensional embeddings to 3D and 4D using PCA/t-SNE, then visualized them interactively with Plotly. 
  The visualizations revealed meaningful clusters, such as characters from the same house appearing close together.</p>
